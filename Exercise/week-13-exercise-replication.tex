\section{Introduction}
Learning inferential statistics is fun (\cite{fisher1937design}). While we do not do a lot of experiments in sociology, many of our techniques were pioneered in experimental settings. Fisher's (\cite*{fisher1937design}) work on experiments is particularly notable. His seminal work includes discussions of the null hypothesis (\cite[15--17]{fisher1937design}). He inspired later work by other pioneering statisticians including Jon Tukey (\cite{mcgill1978variations, tukey1962future}).
